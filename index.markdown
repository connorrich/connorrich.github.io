title: "What's the point of this?"
---

1. I want to keep a personal ledger documenting my notes and completed exercises
2. Basically forcing myself to keep on top of my continued math self study
3. Potentially provide some more in-depth explanations to topics I found rather time consuming/annoying to digest. At times,
math textbooks don't have great explanations.
