## 2A Outer Measure on R

*[← Back](/textbooks/MIRA/chapter-2/)*

Let $\ell(I)$ be the length of an open interval $I$.

**Outer measure** $\|A\|$: The outer measure $\|A\|$ of a set $\|A\|\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is defined by

$$|A|=\inf\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \ell(I_k): I_1, I_2,\ldots \text{ are open intervals such that } A\subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\}$$

- I'm interpreting this as the length of the smallest open cover of a set.

**2.4 Countable sets have outer measure 0:** Every countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has outer measure 0. 

- Not providing the proof, but a finite set has outer measure zero because you can cover each of its finitely many points by intervals whose total length is as small as you like, forcing the infimum of all such covers to be 0.

**2.5 Outer measure preserves order**

**2.8 Countable subadditivity of outer measure:** Suppose $A_1,A_2,\ldots$ is a sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. Then

$$\big{|}\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k|\leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty |A_k|$$

- If each $A_i$ is pairwise disjoint then this is an equality, and if they're not then the summation is an "over estimation".	

**2.12 Heine–Borel Theorem.** Every open cover of a closed, bounded set in $\mathbb{R}$ admits a finite subcover.

**Some of my thoughts which helped me understand the proof:**
1. Let $\mathcal C$ be an open cover of $[a,b]$, and define  
   $$D = \{\,d\in[a,b]: [a,d]\text{ can be covered by finitely many members of }\mathcal C\}.$$
2. Let $s=\sup D$.  Since $\mathcal{C}$ covers $[a,b]$, choose $G\in\mathcal C$ with $s\in G$, and pick $\delta>0$ such that $(s-\delta,s+\delta)\subset G$.
3. Because $s=\sup D$, there exists some $d\in(s-\delta,s]\cap D$.  Since $d\in D$, the interval $[a,d]$ has a finite subcover $G_1,\dots,G_n$.  And because $[d,s]\subset(s-\delta,s+\delta)\subset G$,  
   $$[a,s] = [a,d]\cup[d,s] \;\subset\; G_1\cup\cdots\cup G_n\cup G,$$  
   showing $s\in D$.
4. Then for any $d'\in(s,s+\delta]\cap[a,b]$ we still have $[s,d']\subset G$, so $[a,d']$ is finitely covered too.  Thus $D$ contains a neighborhood to the right of $s$, forcing $s=b$. Almost like we are pushing the supremum more and more forward until its equal to $b$ implying a finite subcover for $[a,b]$.

**2.18 Nonadditivity of outer measure:** There exists disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that 

$$|A\cup B|\neq |A|+|B|$$
